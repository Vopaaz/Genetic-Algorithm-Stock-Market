    abstract = {Abstract In this paper, a genetic algorithm to search a set of technical trading rules which gives buying and selling advices about individual stocks is proposed. This approach is tested out of a sample of 24 French stocks among the most important stocks traded on the French market. We show that in most cases, the method outperforms a simple buy and hold strategy. However, we also illustrate the fact that the near-optimal set of rules varies through time and across stocks.

abstract = "This paper proposes an adaptive genetic algorithm for distributed scheduling problems in multi-factory and multi-product environment. Distributed production strategy enables factories to be more focused on their core product types, to achieve better quality, to reduce production cost, and to reduce management risk. However, when comparing with single-factory production, scheduling problems involved in multi-factory one are more complicated, since different jobs distributed to different factories will have different production scheduling, consequently affect the performance of the supply chain. Distributed scheduling problems deal with the assignment of jobs to suitable factories and determine their production scheduling accordingly. In this paper, a new crossover mechanism named dominated gene crossover will be introduced to enhance the performance of genetic search, and eliminate the problem of determining optimal crossover rate. A number of experiments have been carried out. For the comparison purpose, five multi-factory models have been solved by different well known optimization approaches. The results indicate that significant improvement could be obtained by the proposed algorithm."

	abstract = {We present a genetic algorithm (GA) for structural search that combines the speed of structure exploration by classical potentials with the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) calculations in an adaptive and iterative way. This strategy increases the efficiency of the DFT-based GA by several orders of magnitude. This gain allows a considerable increase in the size and complexity of systems that can be studied by first principles. The performance of the method is illustrated by successful structure identifications of complex binary and ternary intermetallic compounds with 36 and 54 atoms per cell, respectively. The discovery of a multi-TPa Mg-silicate phase with unit cell containing up to 56 atoms is also reported. Such a phase is likely to be an essential component of terrestrial exoplanetary mantles.}

abstract = "Genetic algorithm (GA) is a population-based stochastic optimization technique that has two major problems, i.e. low convergence speed and falling down in local optimum points. This paper introduces an adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) consisting of new crossover and mutation operators to handle these drawbacks. The crossover operator is based on a combination of the traditional crossover mechanism and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) operator. The proposed mutation operator intelligently uses sliding mode control (SMC) to escape from local minimums and converges to the global optimum. The performance of the proposed genetic algorithm is challenged by using twenty well-known test functions. The comparison of the obtained numerical results with those of the other optimization algorithms reported in literature demonstrates the superiority of the proposed algorithm in finding the global optimum points. At the end, the proposed method is employed to estimate the oil demand in Iran based on socio-economic indicators and using linear and exponential forms as a real-world problem that shows the AGA’s effectiveness."
