\section{Introduction}

Predicting the future can only happen in science fictions,
but predicting future trend of some certain time series is feasible.
Time series analysis has a long history, and multiple approaches have been studied.

The most traditional methods are statistical ones such as the well-known ARIMA model.
Although the model is simple, it is still used in recent researches such as \cite{arima-bus-travel}.
Some delicately designed machine learning approaches are also introduced in these years,
varying from relatively simple support vector machine \cite{support-vector-machine}
to complex neural network \cite{time-series-prediction-and-neural-networks}.

The one that receives most attention among all time series is probably the stock price.
Firstly, as an essential part of financial market, stock market is the apple of investors' eyes.
Not only financial researchers but also individuals and securities companies have
tried their best to analyze the stock price time series and predict its behavior in the future,
in order to make a fortune.
Secondly, unlike most time series prediction tasks where the output must be exact future values,
only knowing whether the future price will go up or down is already sufficient to make a trading decision.
Therefore, the problem can be simplified thus enabling more ideas and approaches to be applicable.
Thirdly, sufficient financial indexes and trading rules
can serve as domain knowledge to be combined with computer algorithms.

Nowadays, their are numerous financial indexes, and over two hundred different trading rules were
built upon them to suggest buying, selling or holding decisions,
based on historical stock price time series \cite{stock-timing-using-genetic-algorithms}.
Each rule has its own rationality and will definitely indicate some features of the target stock.
However, the movement of stock price is the combined result of massive number of microeconomic and macroeconomic factors,
which makes it impossible to predict the trend with any index or rule solely.
As Korczak \cite{stock-timing-using-genetic-algorithms} pointed out,
there is no rule consistently outperforming the others.
Therefore, finding the most appropriate way to utilize them becomes the key to the problem.

Although some scholars argue that stock prices follow a random walk pattern,
most experts in this field believe that the prices can be predicted with more than 50 percent accuracy,
with eligible trading rules and reasonable combination \cite{stock-market-prediction-with-multiple-classifiers}.
Plenty of approaches has been examined and we will go through some of them in the literature review.
Noticeably, genetic algorithm is widely used in related researches.

% for instance, neutral networks used by Kimoto et al \cite{stock-market-prediction-system-with-modular-neural-networks}.
% Genetic algorithm is one of them as well.

% Intro GA

In our paper, we will apply genetic algorithm to
find the best combination of a set of trading rules, which can help with the buy and sell decisions.
We will dig deeper for a more comprehensive and applicable solution based on the previous works.

% Implementation details, could be useful in Section Method.

% ---------------- %
% We base on a historical stock price time series in the past \emph{n} periods
% to build an agent to make a final decision of buying and selling.
% % TODO: how many
% More than 10 different financial rules and historical prices information
% in the past three years of 5 stocks are included by us to build our experiment.

% Our experiment is designed to predict the stock price as a search problem.
% Every rule is assigned a weight.
% All these weights constitute a vector, a new, combination rule to predict the prices.
% Each vector is considered as a chromosome.
% Running genetic algorithm on this, we program to find the optimal prediction rule for stocks.
% The final selected agent is considered to have the capacity to make the most optimal buying and selling decisions.

% The experiment is conducted in two phases.
% We divide our dataset into two subsets, a train dataset and a test dataset.
% In the first stage, we will only use the train dataset to find the hyper parameters that lead to the best performance here.
% In the second stage, genetic algorithm will be run on the test dataset to measure performance.
% By this approach, we not only find the optimal solution, but also avoid the over-fitting problem.

% In the following section,
% we describe what other researchers have done in regard to the prediction in stock market,
% especially using genetic algorithm.

\section{Related Work}

We will go through related works about the genetic algorithms first,
then look into its application on the stock time series prediction.

\subsection{Genetic Algorithm}





\subsection{Application of GA to Stock Price Prediction}

Given the stock price time series as the original data,
Stephen Leung et al. \cite{a-novel-stock-forecasting-model-based-on-fuzzy-time-series}
modeled it as a fuzzy time series
by converting the percentage of price change into fuzzy value.
The fuzzy logic relationship are extracted and classified to form fuzzy logic relationship groups (FLRGs).
FLRGs will then be normalized to get a weight matrix.
Each gene in the chromosome corresponds to a fuzzy value
and the whole chromosome will output a prediction.
The fitness function used in the genetic algorithm is:
$$
\text{RMSE} =
\sqrt{ \dfrac {\sum \limits_{t=1}^{n}\left(\operatorname{actual}(t) - \operatorname{predicted}(t)\right)^2 } {n}}
$$

One technique in their approach is worth mentioning.
The tournament method is used to select survivors in the previous generation.
Several ``tournaments" among a few chromosomes chosen at random from the population are conducted.
The winner of each tournament (the one with the best fitness) is selected for crossover.
Comparing with the traditional approach of directly selecting the good ones from the whole population,
it can improve gene diversity thus prevent GA from being trapped in local optimum
\cite{a-note-on-boltzmann-tournament-selecttion}.

Applying the fuzzy logic as well, Kuo, Ren Jie and his team \cite{an-intelligent-stock-trading-decision-support-system}
further choose to combine genetic and neural networks together.
They developed a stock trading system, using GFNN (genetic-algorithm-based fuzzy neural networks)
to build the qualitative model.
The basic model is a FNN (fuzzy neural network), and
genetic algorithm is used to provide the initial weights and select hyper parameters.
This research and some similar ones utilized the optimization feature of genetic algorithm,
but put more emphasis on other techniques.

In addition to those combining multiple methodologies to build a complex model
without the help of domain knowledge,
more studies uses only GA as the algorithm and take the financial indexes and trading rules into account.
They no longer produce exact value for future time series, but provide trading decisions.
As we mentioned before, there are numerous financial indexes,
each summarizing one feature of the stock price time series.
They can be used to build trading rules, which will indicate a decision for buying, selling or holding.
It is the strategy to utilized them that is optimized in those researches.
However, the way they model the problem setting may be slightly different.

Lin Li et al. \cite{the-applications-of-genetic-algorithms-in-stock-market-data-mining}
arbitrarily picked one trading rule, ``the filter rule", and optimize the choice of its parameters.
The fitness function is the profit of trading using its decision.
Comparing with brute force grid search, genetic algorithm saved a lot of running time,
but loses very little precision.
Nevertheless, only using one trading rule limit the model's performance, hence
the profit is still significantly lower than that of human trader.
Most studies are focused on the way of combining multiple financial indexes.

Fuentu et al. \cite{genetic-algorithms-to-optimise-the-time-to-make-stock-market-investment} selected
three financial indexes, RSI, MACD and Stochastic Index,
and five of their variants are coded in the algorithm.
The goal is to find the best time to buy stock, indicated by the values of the five index variants.
Each gene in the chromosome represents an interval of the value of a financial index,
and the fitness function is calculated as below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If there is a time span that could match all the financial indexes represented by the chromosome,
	the chromosome's fitness value is the profit of making the buying decision at the start of that time span.
\item If there is no such time span, the chromosome will not be selected into the next generation.
\end{enumerate}
In the future, when the five financial indexes have the value represented by the best chromosome,
it can be concluded to be the best time to buy a stock.


In some other researches
\cite{genetic-algorithms-for-predicting-the-egyptian-stock-market}
\cite{stock-timing-using-genetic-algorithms}
, the suggestions of trading rules are integrated to give a final trading decision
and such integration is optimized with genetic algorithm.

Firstly, a set of representative trading rules are selected to examine,
such as Moving Average and Relative Strength Index.
Each gene in the chromosome corresponds to one rule,
with only 1 and 0 as their possible values
representing whether the rule should be considered in the final decision.
The final decision is the voting result of all the rules considered.
On each day in the stock time series, the chromosome will give such a final decision,
and the fitness function is the profit made by these decisions.
After that, general genetic algorithm can be applied to find the best chromosome.

This approach is intuitive and relatively easy to implement.
Rohit and Kumkum \cite{a-hybrid-machine-learning-system-for-stock-market-forecasting}
take advantage of it and further uses support vector machine
to determine the weight of each rule in the final decision.

Two concerns about this approach are raised, though.
Firstly, the previous experiments are always run on one stock.
Whether this methodology is suitable for more stocks in the market remains a problem
\cite{genetic-algorithms-for-predicting-the-egyptian-stock-market}.
Secondly, whether the resulting chromosome, i.e. combination of trading rules,
remains useful as time goes by is unknown.
Some experts argue that the influence of time is not obvious,
but it still requires examination
\cite{stock-timing-using-genetic-algorithms}.
Our work will be based on the approach introduced above,
try to address these two issues and hopefully find other insights.
