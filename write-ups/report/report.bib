abstract="Stock market prediction is attractive and challenging. According to the efficient market hypothesis, stock prices should follow a random walk pattern and thus should not be predictable with more than about 50 percent accuracy. In this paper, we investigated the predictability of the Dow Jones Industrial Average index to show that not all periods are equally random. We used the Hurst exponent to select a period with great predictability. Parameters for generating training patterns were determined heuristically by auto-mutual information and false nearest neighbor methods. Some inductive machine-learning classifiers---artificial neural network, decision tree, and k-nearest neighbor were then trained with these generated patterns. Through appropriate collaboration of these models, we achieved prediction accuracy up to 65 percent.",

    abstract = {Abstract In this paper, a genetic algorithm to search a set of technical trading rules which gives buying and selling advices about individual stocks is proposed. This approach is tested out of a sample of 24 French stocks among the most important stocks traded on the French market. We show that in most cases, the method outperforms a simple buy and hold strategy. However, we also illustrate the fact that the near-optimal set of rules varies through time and across stocks.
